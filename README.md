# GOSCAN

GOScan is a simple tcp port scanner, it works with 2 flags so far

-h where you have to specify the host to scan 
-p where you specify the port to connect to 


an example may be 

./goScan -h nmap.org -p 80
./goScan -h nmap.org -p a 

The a value tells the program to run a scan over all the ports
